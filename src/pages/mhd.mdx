# Made-hand Distribution

With the Made-Hand Distribution feature, you can understand which hands or hand classes are best to hold in certain situations. The 18 different hand groups are classified based on their properties, which are influenced by the board structure. This way, you can link the perfect strategy for a specific spot with the hand class, such as having a flush draw, set, etc. The feature has two different distributions:

- One distribution shows how often a hand group takes a specific action, displayed by the color intensity of a hand class bar.
- The other distribution displays the likelihood of having a specific hand class in your current range, giving you a better understanding of the type of hand class in a particular action and its likelihood.
