# Runout Distribution Graph

When you use the Runout Distribution feature, you can see how well a runout hits your range or your opponent's range. The feature includes a table and a graph that show the expected value (EV). The graphs for each player are anti-symmetric due to their relationship.

```
Range-EV(Player1) + Range-EV(Player2) = Pot - Rake
```

<RunoutDistribution />

Let me help you rephrase that. "If you look at the petrol graph, it represents the In-Position `IP` Player and often displays a minimum value when the runout is a spade. This indicates that the `IP` Player has fewer flush draws compared to the Out-of-Position `OOP` Player. Specifically, cards `9` - `A`, particularly `Q` and `K`, have a significant impact on their range. This information is crucial in determining the strategy for the next street and should be understood."
