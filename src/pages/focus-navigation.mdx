# Focus Navigation

The focus navigation feature in our web app is designed to improve accessibility and ease of use for those who prefer or require keyboard controls. This feature highlights the currently active element on the screen and provides a clear visual indication to help users navigate through the app efficiently.

## Active Element Indicator

The active element on the screen is indicated by a teal-colored border when using keyboard controls. This border makes it easy for users to identify which element is currently in focus.

## Forward Navigation

To navigate to the next interactive element on the screen, press the 'Tab' key. This allows users to move through the app with ease, without having to rely on the mouse.

## Reverse Navigation

For reverse navigation, use the 'Shift + Tab' key combination to move back to the previous interactive element on the screen. This enables users to easily navigate in both directions using keyboard controls.

## Interacting with Elements

To 'click' or interact with the focused element, use the 'Enter' or 'Space' key. This functionality provides a seamless way for users to engage with buttons and other interactive elements within the app, further enhancing the overall accessibility and user experience.
