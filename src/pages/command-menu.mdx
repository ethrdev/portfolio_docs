# Command menu

The command menu allows you to quickly access different sections of the app. To open the command menu, simply press ‘Meta + k‘ or ‘Win + k‘ on your keyboard. From there, you can choose between Study mode, Practice mode, Stats overview, Settings, Profile, Changelog, Documentation, and more. The command menu has a clean and intuitive design that makes it easy to find what you're looking for, and the fast navigation means you can move around the app more quickly than ever before.
