# Principles of GTO.

Let me explain what GTO solutions are. They are mathematical models that represent how rational players interact in a game. Poker is an imperfect information game, which means that players don't have complete knowledge of what's going on. However, we can still solve the game using the Nash Equilibrium model, proposed by John Forbes Nash Jr. in 1950. Here are the key properties of this model:

- Players cannot cooperate with each other
- Players always act rationally
- Players aim to maximize their Expected Value (EV) when they reach a Nash Equilibrium
- If either player I or Y changes their GTO strategy, it leads to a higher Nash Distance and results in an EV loss for that player.

## Why use GTO game plans?

By using a game plan based on the GTO model, you can access the most optimal solution available, as it aligns with the principles of the Nash Equilibrium. This helps you understand the fundamental principles of poker and adjust your gameplay to effectively exploit your opponents' mistakes.

## How are PS solutions calculated?

We use a network of virtual machines to power our solver. Each machine has around 512 virtual central processing unit (vCPU) cores and 2 terabytes (TB) of RAM, allowing us to generate the most precise game plan available.

## Accuracy of our solutions

The accuracy of our solutions can be measured by the Nash Distance. Our average Nash Distance is zero point zero three one percent (%), of the pot per hand."
