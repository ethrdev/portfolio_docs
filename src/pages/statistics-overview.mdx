# Statistics overview

You can easily track and visualize your decisions in the "statistics" sheet, which saves every decision in our database. This sheet provides an overview of your performance at a specific spot, and you can use the filter function to refine the results based on specific positions, IP/OOP, x-Bet, Cash Game/MTT/HU, or stack sizes. You can apply multiple filters to get more detailed information about your performance and identify potential leaks.
