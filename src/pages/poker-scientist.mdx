# What is Poker Scientist?

Poker Scientist empowers you to achieve your objectives by providing access to the world's finest Gameplan. Our platform comprises three key components:

## The Gameplan

Our software is designed to be user-friendly and provides quick access to our GTO game plan, which includes billions of strategies for all relevant scenarios. We've made the user interface simple by algorithmically reducing the number of actions and eliminating extraneous lines while maintaining the expected value. Additionally, we have included exclusive insights into the data to enhance your understanding of the game.

## Practical Mode

Practice and improve your poker skills with our GTO bot. The bot will monitor and assess your decisions based on frequency and expected value (EV), helping you to hone your strategy. Your progress is tracked and displayed in "Training Stats," providing you with a comprehensive view of your current performance in any given situation.

## What sets Poker Scientist apart?

### Unparalleled Gameplan Accuracy 

We measure the accuracy of our solver's solutions using a metric called "Nash-Distance," which ranges from `0.01%` to `0.15%` pot per hand. A Nash-Distance of zero represents a perfect solution, but it is practically unattainable due to the need for infinite calculations. With our level of precision, we can distinguish the source of all strategy frequencies between "balancing" and "rounding-error."

### GTO Gameplan Customization

At Poker Scientist, we believe that while GTO is an excellent theoretical framework, it is not always practical in real-world scenarios. Our platform offers various features like "The Simplifier" and "Runout-Clustering" that allow users to adjust GTO strategies to their advantage, giving them a deeper understanding of the game beyond the standard GTO approach. These features enable users to adapt their strategies to exploit their opponents' weaknesses and make better decisions at the table.
