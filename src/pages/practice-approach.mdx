# Practice approach

The practice mode provides an opportunity to receive immediate feedback on your current Gameplan. If you don't have specific information about your weaknesses, such as a "poor winrate in Call to `3Bet` situations," I recommend starting with the most crucial spots: `BUvsBB` and `BUvsSB`. Then, gradually add more spots to your training.

The "Practice stats" offers an overview of your winrates based on the situation and the bot's game style. A practical approach is to focus on training the spots where you have the lowest winrate.

Keep in mind that this Gameplan is the first and only one to be fully solved without any abstractions (i.e., information loss), resulting in larger EV gaps between correct and incorrect decisions. Consequently, having a winrate greater than negative five big blinds per 100 hands is already considered strong, whereas trainers from other software might deem it merely satisfactory."
