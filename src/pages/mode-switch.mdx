# Mode switch

You can switch between the actual training situation and the gameplan mode whenever you like. This means that while you're playing, you can also take a closer look at the situation in a more strategic way.

By doing this, you'll get a better understanding of how the current situation fits into your overall strategy and improve your decision-making skills. It'll make learning more effective and help you make better choices in the game, which in turn will help you to progress and succeed.
