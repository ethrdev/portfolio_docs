# Bot playstyles

Choose from two human-like logics, a tight or an aggressive gameplan, and watch your skills soar. Simply select your preferred play-style via the button on the training screen and watch the Bot adapt.

## Tight playstyle

With the tight Gameplan, the Bot will play passively, only opting for more aggressive actions if the expected value (EV) remains high.

## Aggressive playstyle

On the other hand, the aggressive Gameplan will see Neura play more aggressively, all while keeping the focus on maximizing EV.

## Tight vs. Aggressive\*

A hand for the Bot is with `35%` in the `call` action and `65%` in the `raise` action. This means that the EV difference between call and raise is approximately 0bb. Using the tight Gameplan, the Bot's strategy will change to `100%` `call`, while the aggressive Gameplan will choose `100%` `raise`.
