## Open help sidebar

To make the Help sidebar easily accessible, we have added a new hotkey. Now, you can simply press the ’h’ key to open the sidebar instantly. This should save you time and help you get the assistance you need with minimal disruption to your workflow.

## Mode-specific help information

The Help sidebar now shows context-sensitive help information based on the mode you're currently in. This means that you will see relevant help and guidance for the specific task you are working on, making it easier to find the answers you need without having to search through unrelated information.

## Documentation links

We have made it simpler for you to access our extensive documentation and hotkey overviews. Within the Help sidebar, you'll find links to relevant articles and resources to assist you in navigating and mastering our platform. This should help you find the information you need quickly and efficiently.
